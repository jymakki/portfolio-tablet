      <h2> A citizen of everywhere and nowhere.</h2>

      <p>Third-Culture Kid (TCK): an individual who was raised in a culture other than their parents' or the culture of their country of nationality, and also live in a different environment during a significant part of their child development years.</p>

      <p>Originally Lebanese. Born in the US. Raised in Saudi Arabia. Currently back in the US. </p>

      <p>
        Each bit of my these places play an important part in forming my identity. After moving to Saudi at a young age, attending school from elementary up
        until graduating high school, making friends that became family, and experiencing and becoming a part of the culture,
        I found myself calling Saudi "home". My Lebanese heritage also plays a huge part in who I am. Almost every summer, my family and I
        would visit what was also considered "home". If we weren't visiting Lebanon, we were "back home" visiting family in Southeast Michigan.
        When people ask me "Where are you from?", I always take a deep breath. Do I go with the short and sweet answer or share
        my life experiences without going on for seven whole minutes? It's a daily struggle. Despite of some of the drawbacks, being a TCK has been the greatest blessing and one I am very grateful for.
